## Testing

## Deployment
- ### GitHub Pages
  The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

  2. At the top of the Repository, locate and click the "Settings" Button on the menu.
  3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
  4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "**None**" and select "**main**" branch.

  6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published [site link](https://pinco227.github.io/D-man/) in the "GitHub Pages" section.
- ### Forking the GitHub Repository
  By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [Dublin Hills Repository](https://github.com/pinco227/D-man).
  2. At the top right of the Repository just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate and click the "**Fork**" Button.
  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
- ### Making a Local Clone

  2. At the top of the Repository just above the list of files, locate and click the "**Code**" dropdown.
  3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "**Clone**", make sure "**HTTPS**" is selected and copy the link.
  4. Open Git Bash.
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  6. Type ```git clone```, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
    ```
